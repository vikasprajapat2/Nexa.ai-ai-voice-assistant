# AI Voice Assistant - Setup Guide

## 🎯 What Was Done

Your AI voice assistant now:
- ✅ **Talks with Gemini API** (Google's advanced AI model)
- ✅ **Does NOT save conversation history** (memory replays removed)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Gemini API Key

Create a `.env` file in this directory with your Gemini API key:

```bash
# Copy the example file
copy .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your actual Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Get your free Gemini API key here:** https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:5000`

## 🧹 Optional: Clean Up Old Memory File

Since conversation saving is removed, you can delete the old memory file:

```bash
del nexa_memory.json
```

## 🔧 How It Works Now

1. **User speaks** → Voice input captured
2. **Command processed** → System checks for commands (open apps, search, etc.)
3. **Gemini API** → If not a system command, Gemini AI generates response
4. **Response spoken** → Text-to-speech reads the response
5. **No saving** → Conversation is NOT saved to file

## 📝 Features

### System Commands (Still Work!)
- "Open Google and search iPhone"
- "Open YouTube and play music"
- "Type hello world"
- "What time is it?"
- "Open calculator"
- "Open notepad"

### AI Conversations (Powered by Gemini)
- Ask questions
- Get information
- Have natural conversations
- All responses generated by Gemini AI

### What's Removed
- ❌ Conversation history saving
- ❌ Learning from past conversations
- ❌ Memory file (`nexa_memory.json`)
- ❌ `/api/stats` endpoint

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "GEMINI_API_KEY not found"
- **Solution:** Make sure you created `.env` file with your API key

**Issue:** App won't start
- **Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies

**Issue:** Gemini not responding
- **Solution:** Check your API key is valid and you have internet connection

## 📚 API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main web interface
- `POST /api/command` - Send voice command, get AI response
- `GET /api/nexa-model-stats` - Get custom Nexa AI model statistics
- `GET /api/nexa-knowledge` - Export Nexa AI's learned knowledge

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your AI voice assistant is now configured to use Gemini API without saving conversation history.
